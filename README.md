# habitatfinder
 Python script for creating a weighted sum in ArcGIS Pro using portal items.
 • The script is published here as habitatfinder.py
 • A markdown of this script can be found at index.html or the web address for this page which is https://wwiskes.github.io/habitatfinder/
 • A run-able markdown can be found at HabitatFinder.ipynb
 • A shapefile of the kernal contour output is included here as an example, as well as a raster of the modeloutput as well
 Pictured below is a print out of what this looks like run in the Spyder console. You can see run times are pretty long, this is primarily because of pulling files out of Portal.
