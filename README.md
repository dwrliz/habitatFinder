# habitatFinder
 Python script for creating a weighted sum with user defined inputs in ArcGIS Pro using portal items. It considers elevation, vegetation height, and vegetation type.
 <br>
 • The script is published here as habitatfinder.py
 <br>
 • A markdown of this script can be found at index.html or the web address for this page which is https://wwiskes.github.io/habitatFinder/
 <br>
 • A run-able markdown can be found at habitatFinder.ipynb
 <br>
 • A shapefile of the kernel contour output is included here as an example, as well as a raster of the modeloutput
 <br>
 Pictured below is a print out of what this looks like run in the Spyder console. You can see run times are pretty long, this is primarily because of pulling files out of Portal. Make certain to really have your parameters defined the way you want before running. The scripts default parameters are for Black-throated Gray Warbler (BTYW).
